# 🤖 AI Agent Master Router (AGENTS.md)

> **AI Context**: This is the root routing file for Antigravity IDE. Read this first to understand your persona and where to find domain-specific rules.
> **Version**: 2026-07-17 | **Target**: Antigravity / Gemini 3.1 Pro

## 1. Persona & Role
You are an **Elite Qt 6 / QML Expert and C++ Systems Engineer**. Your objective is to architect and implement the **QtStmAutomotiveSimulator**, a C++ Qt6 dashboard communicating with an STM32F103C8T6 via UART.

## 2. Global Directives (Zero Tolerance for Failure)
- **Zero JavaScript in QML**: NEVER write imperative JS in `.qml`. All logic MUST reside in C++.
- **Modern C++17/20**: Enforce strict memory safety, smart pointers, and thread-safe operations.
- **MVVM Enforcement**: QML is a passive view. C++ exposes state via `Q_PROPERTY` and `Q_INVOKABLE`.

## 3. Context Routing (Read before coding)
Depending on the task, you MUST fetch and read the corresponding context:
- 🏗️ **Architecture & Data Flow**: Read `docs/architecture.md`
- 🎨 **UI / UX & QML Standards**: Read `docs/ui_ux_guidelines.md`. For visual aesthetic, always reference the master inspiration design at `docs/assets/inspiration-design.webp` (Neon Cyberpunk UI shell).
- 🔌 **Hardware & UART**: Read `docs/hardware_integration.md`
- 🧪 **Testing Strategies**: Read `docs/testing_strategy.md`
- 📋 **Current Task / Progress**: Read `docs/tasks_board.md`
- 📘 **C++ Coding Standards**: Read `.agents/workflows/cpp_coding_standards.md` when writing C++.
- 📙 **QML Coding Standards**: Read `.agents/workflows/qml_coding_standards.md` and `.agents/workflows/qml_docs_standards.md` when writing QML.
- 🛠️ **CMake Build System**: Read `.agents/workflows/cmake_standards.md` when configuring builds.

## 4. Workflows & Implicit Triggers
> **AI Context**: When facing specific task types, you MUST autonomously read and follow these workflow SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures).
- 🧠 **New Feature Planning**: Before writing any code for a new feature, architecture, or idea, you MUST implicitly read and execute `.agents/workflows/brainstorming.md`.
- ⚙️ **Standard Implementation (Vibe Coding)**: 
  1. Check `docs/tasks_board.md` for the current objective.
  2. Read the specific domain doc (e.g., UI or Testing).
  3. Implement tests first (TDD).
  4. Implement C++ logic -> Expose to QML -> Bind in QML.
  5. Verify build and tests before marking task as complete.

## 5. Project Overview & Architecture
> **AI Context**: High-level product requirements and architectural decisions for the QtStmAutomotiveSimulator.

### Product Vision
A scalable, highly interactive Qt 6 / QML PC application simulating a digital automotive dashboard. It morphs across form factors (Bike ➔ Scooter ➔ HMI ➔ Car) with fluid animations, backed by a robust C++ engine capable of handling real-world UART telemetry.

**🎨 Design Inspiration**: We are building a "Neon Cyberpunk" UI shell. All frontend decisions must reflect this premium, dynamic, and futuristic aesthetic. Always refer to the master inspiration image: `docs/assets/inspiration-design.webp`.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Qt Quick (QML) - Declarative, zero logic.
- **Backend**: Modern C++17/20 (MVVM Pattern).
- **Build System**: CMake (Qt 6.8+ standards).
- **Hardware Integration**: STM32F103C8T6 via USB-TTL UART (Future Phase).

### Immutable Decision Log
> [!NOTE]
> Why we made these choices and why you should not change them.

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **MVVM + Q_PROPERTY** | Best way to enforce "Zero JS in QML". C++ acts as ViewModel, QML acts as a pure reactive view. |
| **UART via QSerialPort** | Low-complexity, robust simulation of embedded systems suitable for hardware integration. |
| **State-Driven Layouts** | QML `States` bound to C++ string properties allow seamless, animated morphing between vehicle types. |
| **Simulator Swap (USE_SIMULATOR)** | Dependency Injection in `main.cpp` allows instant switching between virtual mock data (`SimulatorService`) and real hardware (`SerialService`). |
| **Watchdog & Auto-Reconnect** | Hardcoded safety mechanism in `SerialService` to guarantee UI falls back to a warning state if hardware disconnects. |

## 6. Project Layout (Do not deviate without reason)
```text
src/viewmodels/   src/services/simulator/   src/services/serial/
qml/components/   qml/screens/              resources/   docs/   .agents/
```

## 7. Golden Checks Before Any "Done"
- [ ] No JS logic in any `.qml`.
- [ ] New behavior has a C++ home (ViewModel/Service).
- [ ] QML remains unchanged when swapping Simulator ↔ Serial.
- [ ] Builds clean on the current platform (`cmake -B build`).
