# Vibe Coding Documentation Standards

> **AI Context**: This file defines the Markdown structure standards (as of 2026) for the entire project to ensure Antigravity AI Agents can parse and ingest context with absolute precision.

## 1. Mandatory Structure for a `.md` File
Every Markdown file in the `docs/` directory MUST adhere to the following format:

1. **Header & Context (Top Section)**
   - Must always start with an H1 (`# Clear Document Title`).
   - The second line must always be a Blockquote defining the context for AI.
   ```markdown
   # Document Title
   
   > **AI Context**: [A brief, precise 1-2 sentence description of the file's purpose so AI can parse it quickly].
   ```

2. **Alerts & Constraints**
   - It is mandatory to use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) Alerts for strict rules. LLMs parse these blocks highly efficiently.
   - `> [!WARNING]`: Used for rules that MUST NOT be violated (e.g., No JS in QML).
   - `> [!IMPORTANT]`: Used for critical architectural decisions.
   - `> [!NOTE]`: Used for general observations or contextual notes.

3. **Code Formatting**
   - Every code block MUST declare its language explicitly.
   - Use ` ```cpp `, ` ```qml `, ` ```cmake `. Never leave ` ``` ` empty.

## 2. Troubleshooting Section
Every technical guide (e.g., `hardware_integration.md` or `architecture.md`) should include a **Troubleshooting** section at the bottom.
- **Purpose**: When the AI (Vibe Coder) encounters a build error or logic bug, it can autonomously look up this section to self-correct without asking the human for help.

## 3. Memory & Workflows System
- **`tasks_board.md`**: Should only contain task lists (Todo, In-Progress, Done). No lengthy explanations.
- **`journal.md`**: The place to document the reasoning behind technical decisions (Chronological Log) to prevent the AI from experiencing "amnesia" when the context window is cleared.
- **`.agents/workflows/`**: The designated location for step-by-step workflow guidelines (e.g., TDD, Brainstorming) instead of cluttering the System Prompt.
